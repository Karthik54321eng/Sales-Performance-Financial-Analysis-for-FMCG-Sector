F)Objective:

1)To evaluate customer performance,

2)TO understand their market performance with respect to their target,

3)Optimize their sales strategies,

4)Enhance customer satisfaction,

5)Maximize revenue generation.

=========================================================================

G)MS - Excel Reports:

1)Customer Performance Report:

Created a detailed analysis of customer performance over the years, highlighting sales figures and growth percentages.

2)Market Performance and Sales Targets Comparison:

Conducted a comprehensive comparison between market performance and sales targets, providing insights into the success of sales strategies.

3)Financial Performance - Quarterly:

Generated Profit and Loss reports categorized by fiscal year and months to evaluate financial performance over different time frames.

4)Revenue Contribution - Three Divisions:

Created Profit and Loss reports categorized by markets to aid in benchmarking against industry peers and previous periods.

=========================================================================

H)Key Insights:

a)Customers Performance:

1)Explosive Growth in 2021; NS tripling (196.7M -> 598.9M).

2)Amazon has highest Net Sales in 2021 - 82M; Nova - .4M.

3)Top 3 Customer - Amazon(82M), AtliQ Exclusive(61M), AtliQ e Store(53M).

4)Customers to focus – Nova (0.4M), ElecticalsBea Stores (0.7M), All Out (0.8M). (NS less than 1M).

5)Fast Growing Customers - Integration Stores, Chiptec, Electricalsquipo Stores.

b)Markets Performance:

1)Top Performing Markets (High Sales, Low Gap %):
  India (161M, -5.6%), USA (87M, -10.4%), South Korea (49M, -8.2%).

2)In terms of Target Gap:
  USA (10M), India (9.5M), Canada (5M).

3)Target Gap % - Poland (-15%), Canada (-13%), Spain (-12%).

c)Atliq's Three Divisions Contribution:

1)P&A-56%, PC-27%, N&S-17%.

2)In all division - GM% in 2021 = 36%.

3)Total Gross Margin increases YoY, GM% decreases (41%->36%) YoY.
  3.1)Raising COGS,
  3.2)For Market Penetration - Strategic Pricing to gain MS%.

4)PC Division: Explosive Growth, But Margin Dilution.
  4.1)Net Sales grew 313.7%, but GM% fell by 3.6%
  4.2)Suggests volume-driven growth, possibly through low-margin channels like e-commerce or resellers.

d)Finance Performance in Quarterly basis:

1)Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Margin remains high in Q2(Nov, Dec, Jan) in all the three years.

2)In all years, GM% remains approx. same for all months.

3)FY 2020 shows a sharp dip in March (only $2.1M in sales), possibly pandemic-related.

4)FY 2021 stabilizes with consistent monthly sales ~$44M, suggesting operational maturity.

=========================================================================

I)Key Recommendations:

1)While Gross Margin (profitability metrics) has improved YOY, the declining Gross Margin% suggests AtliQ facing cost pressures or shifting 
  towards lower-margin segments. This calls for a deeper dive into pricing strategy, cost optimization, and product mix realignment.

2)While AtliQ achieved a 300% YOY growth in net sales 2021, fell short of 2021 target by 8.4%.
  This gap is concentrated in a few key markets like Poland, Canada, and Spain. 
  A deeper dive into channel performance and pricing strategy in these regions will help us recalibrate our forecasts and improve execution.

3)Customer Segmentation:
  3.1) Strategic Customers (high volume, consistent growth).
  3.2) Emerging Customers (high growth %, low base).
  3.3) Dormant Customers (flat or declining sales).

4)AtliQ Hardwares achieved remarkable growth across all divisions in 2021. 
  However, the declining Gross Margin % highlights rising cost pressures and a shift toward lower-margin segments. 
  In P & A division, a deeper dive into cost structure and pricing strategy to protect profitability.

=========================================================================

J)Conclusion:

 This analysis enabled AtliQ Hardware to pinpoint underperforming markets, identify high-growth customers, and optimize division-level profitability. By leveraging advanced 
 Excel techniques and financial modelling, the project delivered actionable insights that supported strategic sales expansion and improved revenue alignment across 23 countries.
